# Introduction

The Bagels is a command-line based detective logic game created using Python.
The Idea comes from Ai Stewgart of the book author "Big Book Small Python Projects"

### Requirements for Runtime

Bagels is a python written code. That means you need to install the python language in your machine. 
After _verifying_ the python is installed, just type this on the directory command line~
```
python main.py
```

### How does it work?
_Note that the behavior is sightly different from this one. That includes being unpolished but no cares?_

```
Bagels, a deductive logic game.
By Al Sweigart al@inventwithpython.com
I am thinking of a 3-digit number. Try to guess what it is.
Here are some clues:
When I say: That means:
 Pico One digit is correct but in the wrong position.
 Fermi One digit is correct and in the right position.
 Bagels No digit is correct.
I have thought up a number.
 You have 10 guesses to get it.
Guess #1:
> 123
Pico
Guess #2:
> 456
Bagels
Guess #3:
> 178
Pico Pico
--snip--
Guess #7:
> 791
Fermi Fermi
Guess #8:
> 701
You got it!
Do you want to play again? (yes or no)
> no
Thanks for playing!
```

The code that I written is completely my own. For Ai Stewgart's solution of this project, you can check it out on the page 31-32 of the book [_Small Book, Small Python Projects_](https://inventwithpython.com/bigbookpython/)

### Additional Notes üìù
This code is only coded for supporting a 3-length answer/question. You can expand it by modifying the code. The main features are also encapsulated so that you can add in new features with ease!
