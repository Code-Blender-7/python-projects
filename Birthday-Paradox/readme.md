# Introduction

Birthday Paradox is a Python analysis program where you can find the percentage of the two people having the same birth date. This process is completely simple and efficient.


### Runtime Requirements

Birthday Paradox requires Python installed in your machine for it to work.
Afterwards, run standard python execution commands to activate the program
```
python main.py
```

### Usage [READ THIS PLEASE!]
This program requires a value (1 < _n_ <= 100) for generating the arrays. Follow the demo for precise instructions.

Birthday Paradox runs over thousands of simulations over a single birthday array. For PC performances, the default is 100,000 simulations. Please don't insert a value of arrays over 80 as it will bottleneck your computer performance.
